### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently working on my side project Refocus: Pomodoro Timer, which you can find on the [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.poliziano.notanotherpomodoroapp). In the future I plan on developing an iOS and web version.

My preferred frameworks and languages are:
- nodejs
- TypeScript
- Android (Kotlin + Compose)
- Angular
- React
